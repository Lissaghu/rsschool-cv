## About me:

Ever since childhood, I knew that my life would be connected with computers, but I did not know how exactly. Quite a long time ago I had an interest in programming. I looked closely and chose JavaScript, because I can immediately see the result of my work - which I am incredibly admired. I studied layout and practiced on layouts. I am currently studying JavaScript. I have excellent communication and teamwork skills. I quickly find a solution in stressful situations. Calm and reasonable, but with a great sense of humor and charisma.

## Skills:

* HTML
* CSS/SASS
* Responsive/adaptive layout
* JavaScript (Basic)
* Git/GitHub

## Code examples:

` 
  function sumInput() {

    let numbers = [];
  
    while (true) {
  
      let value = prompt("Enter the number", 0);
  
      // Stop entering?
      if (value === "" || value === null || !isFinite(value)) break;
  
      numbers.push(+value);
    }
  
    let sum = 0;
    for (let number of numbers) {
      sum += number;
    }
    return sum;
  }
  alert( sumInput() );
