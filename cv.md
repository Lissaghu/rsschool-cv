## About me:

Ever since childhood, I knew that my life would be connected with computers, but I did not know how exactly. Quite a long time ago I had an interest in programming. I looked closely and chose JavaScript, because I can immediately see the result of my work - which I am incredibly admired. I studied layout and practiced on layouts. I am currently studying JavaScript. I have excellent communication and teamwork skills. I quickly find a solution in stressful situations. Calm and reasonable, but with a great sense of humor and charisma.
